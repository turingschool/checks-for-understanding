## Week Two - Module 3

Some of these questions are from this week, some are from previous weeks, and some are new concepts. Try answering without research first. If you are not sure, take a guess but acknowledge that it's a guess (faking an answer in an interview without acknowledging it as a guess is a bad idea). Follow up with the necessary research to understand these concepts. These tend to be common themes during the job hunt and are worth having a solid understanding of.
